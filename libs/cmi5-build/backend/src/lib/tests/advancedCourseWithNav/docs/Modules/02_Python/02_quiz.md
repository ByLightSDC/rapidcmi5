	1. [ ] Complied
	1. [ ] neither
	1. [ ] both
	
    ### LSA 2-1 Which Error occurs when a program can't execute the instructions?


	- [ ] Logic
	- [ ] Semantic
	- [x] Runtime
    
    ### LSA 2-2 **True or False**: Python's Syntax refers to a set of rules and structures that dictate how code is written in the language


	- [x] True
	- [ ] False

    ### LSA 3-1 Which of the following is a proper comment in python?
    
    - [x] ```#this one``` 
    - [ ] ```//this one```
    - [ ] ```??this one```
    - [ ] ```/this one```

    ### LSA 3-2  How does python define blocks of code?

    - [ ] curly bracket }
    - [ ] uses a slash \ 
    - [X] using white space and indentation 
    - [ ] it uses a dollar sign $ 

    ### LSA 4-1 What does REPL Stand for? 
    
    - [ ] Read-Execute-Print-Loop
    - [X] Read-Evaluate-Print-Loop
    - [ ] Respond-Equal-Print-Loop
    - [ ] Read-Evaluate-Ponder-layout

    ### LSA 4-2 Besides the REPL or Interactive shell what is another way we can execute Python? 
    
    - [ ] using a subnet
    - [X] batch
    - [ ] a programming langauge to call python
    - [ ] using Powershell ISE

    ### LSA 5-1 How do you run python (without the shebang in the file) in the command-line? 
    
    - [x] ```python3 /pathtofile.py ```
    - [ ] ```py /path-to-file.sh ```
    - [ ] ```/usr/py-thon /path-to-file.py```
    - [ ] ```snake \pathtofile.py```

    ### LSA 5-2 how do you run python (with the shebang in the file) in the command-line? 
    
    - [x] ```./pathtofile.py ```
    - [ ] ```run .\path-to-file.sh ```
    - [ ] ```snake-run ./path-to-file.py```
    - [ ] ```python .\pathtofile.py```

    ### LSA 6-1 When working in the REPL, what happens after the Python interpreter "Reads" the user's input?

    - [ ] It prints the input directly
    - [x] It evaluates the input as a Python expression
    - [ ] It waits for more input
    - [ ] It exits the loop immediately

    ### LSA 6-2 How does the execution of Python code from the REPL shell differ from a batch approach?

    - [ ] REPL involves reading input files, while batch does not
    - [ ] Batch requires an interactive environment, while REPL does not
    - [X] REPL allows immediate feedback, while batch processes instructions sequentially
    - [ ] Batch is more suitable for small code snippets, while REPL is for large programs
    
    ### LSA 7-1 How do you take input from a user in python? 

    - [ ] with the ``` scanf()``` function
    - [ ] you use the ```read()``` function

    - [ ] you use the ```evaluate()``` function

    ### LSA 7-2 inside the python shell how can I get to the help session?
    - [x] ```help()```
    - [ ] ```python --help```
    - [ ] ```-help```
    - [ ] ```hlep```
